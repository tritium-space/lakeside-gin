### Viewing the site locally

Simply view the `index.html` in your favorite browser.

### Deployment

The webpage is hosted on [Hostpoint](hostpoint.ch).
There is a WIP for an automatic deployment to the hosting, disposing of the need of a FileZilla FTP client.

### Structure

The webpage is organized in an HTML file per page, each with its own CSS File for page-specific styles. `styles.css` includes the global styles such as the global variables.

## Libraries

The library [Universal Parallax](https://marrio-h.github.io/universal-parallax/demo/) was used for the parallax effect.
